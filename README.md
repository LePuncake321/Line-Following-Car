## Line Following Car by the Bombastic Bierman Club

Contained in the Media folder are pictures of our team with the car itself, and a video demonstrating the car's final run through a course of black tape, with three unique additions:
1. A section of green tape where the car needs to do a donut upon reaching it
2. A large obstacle that the car needs to first detect, and then avoid and reach the rest of the course
3. A section of red tape at the end, on which the car must stop moving and end its program
